FUNCTION "dropsort"

  From http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/dropsort.html:

  Dropsort is a fast, one-pass sorting algorithm suitable for many
  applications.

  Algorithm Description Dropsort is run on an ordered list of numbers by
  examining the numbers in sequence, beginning with the second number in
  the list. If the number being examined is less than the number before
  it, drop it from the list. Otherwise, it is in sorted order, so keep
  it. Then move to the next number.

  After a single pass of this algorithm, the list will only contain
  numbers that are at least as large as the previous number in the
  list. In other words, the list will be sorted!  Analysis Dropsort
  requires exactly n-1 comparisons to sort a list of length n, making
  this an O(n) algorithm, superior to the typical O(n logn) algorithms
  commonly used in most applications.

  Dropsort is what is known in the computer science field as a lossy
  algorithm. It produces a fast result that is correct, but at the cost
  of potentially losing some of the input data. Although to those not
  versed in the arts of computer science this may seem undesirable,
  lossy algorithms are actually a well-accepted part of computing. An
  example is the popular JPEG image compression format, which enjoys
  widespread use because of its versatility and usefulness. In similar
  fashion, dropsort promises to revolutionise the sorting of data in
  fields as diverse as commercial finance, government record-keeping,
  and space exploration.
